# action-spice-labs-surveyor

A composite GitHub Action that runs the Spice Labs Surveyor CLI to create an Artifact Dependency Graph (ADG) from a directory of built files (e.g., Rust binaries, OCI layout (unpacked) Docker images, JAR files), then uploads the resulting ADG to the Spice Labs servers.

---

### Features

- Surveys a directory with the `spicelabs/spice-labs-cli` container and produces an ADG
- Uploads the generated ADG to your Spice Labs project using a Spice Pass (JWT)

---

### Usage

```yaml
- name: Build ADG
  uses: spice-labs-inc/action-spice-labs-surveyor@v3
  with:
    input: target/release/            # Optional; defaults to '.'
    spice_pass: ${{ secrets.SPICE_PASS }} # Required
    tag: 'my-survey-tag'                  # Required

```

### Optional: pin or override the CLI image
